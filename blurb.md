# Michael Fine

Hi, I'm Michael.

I'm a privacy researcher and software engineer. I work at [Apple](https://www.apple.com), researching differentially private machine learning. Before that, I studied Computer Science at [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu, where I did my [thesis](michaelhfine.com/thesis.pdf) on using GANs for practical, differentially private synthetic data with accuracy guarantees.

Previously, I worked at: [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com), where I used [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) to enable blazing fast access to trading data from Python; [Uber ATG](https://www.uber.com/us/en/atg/, where I gutted [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) to turn it into a stateless, remote IDE for autonomous vehicles; and [Hillary for America](https://www.hillaryclinton.com), where I worked on a potpourri of data infrastructure projects and internal tools. 

Some other research topics that fascinate me are: strategic classificationhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06980, functional programming and type systems, developer tooling, and the intersection of law and CS. 

When I'm not working, you can often find me playing around in the kitchen, or going on long hikes. You can reach me at mfine15 {at} gmail.
